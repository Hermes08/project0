Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Hello there

In this project I am including some personal information about my life and daily routine.

Almost all html files are sharing the same StyleSheet file but one.

index.html is the Home page where you can access all of the website.
believes.html has some information about my believes.
dreams.html has some information about my dreams.
hobbies.html has more information about my hobbies.
phrases.html has some information about phrases I like.

Over all all the pages above are sharing the same bootstrap Grid model template, also have different stylesheets that are the same for all of them.

testscss.html is my testing ground for scss and I think is working fine for now. Also I included a table at the bottom since it was required for the project.


All of the sites have an image and the classes and id selectors are used in all of the websites.
Mobile Responsive design is added as well.
Nesting - Inheritance and other Scss functionalities are running on testscss.html as it was required for the project.
